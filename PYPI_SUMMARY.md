## 📋 Files You Need to Update

Before publishing, update these files:

### setup.py
```python
author="Your Name",                                    # ← Change this
author_email="your.email@example.com",                # ← Change this
url="https://github.com/yourusername/postgres-backup-plugin",  # ← Change this
```

### pyproject.toml
```toml
authors = [
    {name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"}  # ← Change this
]
...
[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/yourusername/postgres-backup-plugin"  # ← Change this
```

### CHANGELOG.md
Update with your release notes

### README.md (optional)
Update examples, GitHub URLs, etc.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **NEVER commit .pypirc to Git**
   - Already in .gitignore
   - Contains sensitive API tokens

2. **Use API tokens, not passwords**
   - More secure
   - Can be revoked
   - Scoped permissions

3. **Keep tokens secret**
   - Don't share in screenshots
   - Don't paste in public issues
   - Rotate periodically

4. **Enable 2FA on PyPI**
   - Extra security layer
   - Protects against account hijacking

---

## 📊 After Publishing

### Monitor Your Package

1. **PyPI Stats**
   - https://pypistats.org/packages/postgres-backup-plugin
   - Download counts
   - Python versions used

2. **PyPI Page**
   - https://pypi.org/project/postgres-backup-plugin/
   - User feedback
   - Issues reported

3. **GitHub** (if using)
   - Stars, forks, issues

## 🔄 Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

1.0.0 → 1.0.1  (Bug fixes)
1.0.0 → 1.1.0  (New features, backward compatible)
1.0.0 → 2.0.0  (Breaking changes)
```

### Publishing Updates

```bash
# Bug fix (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
./publish.sh 1.0.1 test
./publish.sh 1.0.1 prod

# New feature (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
./publish.sh 1.1.0 test
./publish.sh 1.1.0 prod

# Breaking change (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
./publish.sh 2.0.0 test
./publish.sh 2.0.0 prod
```

Remember to update CHANGELOG.md for each version!

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "File already exists"
**Solution:** Bump version number. PyPI doesn't allow re-uploading.

### Issue: "Invalid distribution"
**Solution:**
```bash
twine check dist/*  # See what's wrong
# Fix issues, rebuild
```

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution:** Check ~/.pypirc token, generate new one if expired.

### Issue: README not rendering
**Solution:** Validate Markdown:
```bash
pip install readme-renderer
python -m readme_renderer README.md -o /tmp/test.html
```

### Issue: Package not found after upload
**Solution:** Wait 1-2 minutes for PyPI to index.
